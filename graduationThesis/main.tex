\chapter*{Abstract}
Let's assume that in one of these days a programmer decides to write a 3D application. It can be anything from flight simulators to shooter games. The point is our guy wants his application to have 3D objects which he can model with an external tool and nice effects, obtained with particle engines, like fire, smoke or water.
