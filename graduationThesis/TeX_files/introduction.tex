\section{Brief History of Computer Graphics}
First of all, what is \textit{computer graphics}? The term first appeared in 1960 and it was made-up by William Fetter who was, at the time, a computer graphics researcher for Boeing. The term refers to a subfield of computer science which deals with image data representation and manipulation using computers.\\

The first computer able to do graphics is the Whirlwind computer. Its development was started in 1945 at MIT by a team of computer scientists led by Jay Forrester. The purpose of this computer was to make aircraft tracking possible on a large oscilloscope screen via a graphical application. Although the aircraft tracking application was the first application in the field of computer graphics it was not interactive. It could only display the real time positions of the tracked aircrafts. The first interactive graphical application was Tennis For Two and it was created by William Higinbotham because he wanted to kill the boredom of the visitors of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\\

In 1959 the TX-2 computer emerged. This computer was used by Ivan Sutherland to program the Sketchpad, a tool for creating very precise engineering drawings. The software offered its users the possibility to draw lines and circle arcs. The lines could then be made perfectly parallel or perpendicular in order to fit the users drawing needs. Sketchpad is known to be the first graphical user interface or GUI in short form.\\

In 1966 Ivan Sutherland made yet another contribution to the field of computer graphics by inventing the Sword of Damocles the first computer controlled head mounted display. This device displayed two stereoscopic images of the same wire-frame mesh. Two decades later NASA would use his methods in virtual reality research.\\

Very soon after, in 1970 actually, the field of computer graphics was upgraded by Henri Gouraud, Jim Blinn and Bui Tuong Phong. The first added the Gouraud shading model and the other two added the Blinn-Phong shading model. In 1978 Jim Blinn also added bump mapping to the computer graphics field.
\section{Brief History of Particle Systems}
The term \textit{particle system} was coined in 1982 by William T. Reeves who was a computer graphics researcher for Lucasfilm Ltd., a film production company known for films like the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. But what is a particle system? Here's the original definition:\\

"A particle system is a collection of many minute particles that together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system."\\

--William T. Reeves--acm Transactions On Graphics--April 1983--Vol. 2, No. 2\\

At Lucasfilm Ltd. Reeves helped to develop the wall of fire effect which occurred every time the Genesis Device was used in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This fictional device had the amazing ability to transform any lifeless planet into a perfectly habitable place. Though this is not the first time when particle systems have been used in the computer industry, this particular effect helped to coin down the term \textit{particle systems}.\\ 

The first particle systems were implemented in the earliest video games where this concept was used to portray exploding spaceships which left behind many little dots or lines. For example "Spacewar!" which appeared in 1962 and "Asteroid" which appeared later in 1978 had such effects implemented. Since their dawn till the very present particle systems have been used to implement various interesting phenomena such as fire, smoke or waterfalls. In the absence of particle systems these phenomena would be very difficult to implement if not impossible.

\section{The Necessity of Particle Systems}
An alternate solution to the problem of modeling objects that are "fuzzy", as William T. Reeves used to call them, would be to use surface-based representations (the ones which are used to model objects like cars or spaceships). Now, if one starts to think a little it wouldn't be a very natural approach of the problem to try to model an object which has no smooth surfaces, perhaps a cloud of smoke, with a series of triangles where each triangle represents a surface which actually does not exist on the real object. Sure, one could easily implement such a smoke cloud using triangles to represent its margins but the results would not be very realistic. If a large number of very small triangles were to be used then the smoke cloud would look better, in fact the smaller the triangles and the larger the count of the triangles the better the quality of the image. But there is a downside to this approach.\\

Let's imagine what would happen to the previously mentioned smoke cloud if a sudden wind gust were to hit it. The smoke cloud would most certainly move in the direction of the wind. Only with the surface-based representation it would move in the direction of the wind as a whole just like a very large balloon would. The representation of the smoke cloud would not be very realistic because in real life when a smoke cloud gets hit by a lateral wind force some pieces of it go with the wind while others go in completely different directions or move slightly from their initial position. Those pieces of the smoke cloud are actually particles of smoke. So if particle systems are used to "implement" smoke clouds in real life, why wouldn't this concept be used as well in the implementation of a smoke cloud which would only exist inside a graphical application.\\
