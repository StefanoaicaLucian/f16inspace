\section{A Brief History of Computer Graphics}
First of all, what is \textit{computer graphics}? The term first appeared in 1960 and it was made-up by William Fetter who was, at that time, a computer graphics researcher at Boeing. The term refers to a subfield of computer science which deals with image data representation and manipulation using computers.\\
The first computer able to do graphics is the Whirlwind computer. Its development was started in 1945 at MIT by a team of computer scientists led by Jay Forrester. The purpose of this computer was to make flight simulation possible on a large oscilloscope screen.\\
