\section{A Brief History of Computer Graphics}
First of all, what is \textit{computer graphics}? The term first appeared in 1960 and it was made-up by William Fetter who was, at the time, a computer graphics researcher at Boeing. The term refers to a subfield of computer science which deals with image data representation and manipulation using computers.\\
The first computer able to do graphics is the Whirlwind computer. Its development was started in 1945 at MIT by a team of computer scientists led by Jay Forrester. The purpose of this computer was to make graphical aircraft tracking possible on a large oscilloscope screen.\\
Although the tracking application was the first application in the field of computer graphics it was not interactive. It could only display the real time position of the tracked aircrafts. The first interactive graphical application was Tennis For Two and it was created by William Higinbotham because he wanted to kill the boredom of the visitors of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\\
In 1959 the TX-2 computer emerged. This computer was used by Ivan Sutherland to program the Sketchpad a tool for creating very precise drawings. This piece of software is known to be the first GUI which is an acronym for Graphical User Interface.
